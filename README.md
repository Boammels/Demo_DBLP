Hi, this is my achievement for the previous terms. 

There are two folders under this repository, one is for the data extraction and the other one is for the demo.

For data extraction, please check the Readme.md in that folder. After data extraction, two json files should be added to the route folder.

For the demo, make sure to use python to run the backend and React to run the frontend.

If you have any questions regarding my code, feel free to contact me on wangsihang0906@gmail.com. Cheers!
